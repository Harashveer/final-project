          <p class="info">
            Released in Japan and North America in late 1993, the system
            features interchangeable hardware expansions known as PACs, which
            enable compatibility with Mega Drive and Mega-CD games, PC Engine
            and PC Engine CD-ROM² games, and a new type of LaserDisc-based
            format: Mega LD and LD-ROM².
            Pioneer Electronics (USA) and NEC Home Electronics released this module that allows users to play 8-inch and 12-inch LaserActive LD-ROM² discs, as well as CD-ROM² and Super CD-ROM² discs, HuCards and CD+G discs. The Japanese version of the PAC can also run Arcade CD-ROM² discs through the use of an Arcade Card Duo. The retail price was US $600. It came with a LaserActive-branded version of NEC's Turbo Pad (CPD-N1/CPD-N10). An NEC branded version of the LD-ROM² PAC known as the PC Engine PAC (model PCE-LP1) was also released. Due to the unpopularity of the TurboGrafx-16 in North America, very few PAC-N10 units were produced, resulting in their scarcity compared to its Sega counterpart.
